	<h1>Vacancies</h1>

<p>The Mobility DesAIgn Lab has two vacancies available for postdoc positions at Delft University of Technology.</p>
</div>

<h2>Postdoc in Design Generation and Evaluation</h2>

<p>The global urbanization and growth of cities lead to a significant increase in mobility and logistics while the amount of space available is scarce. IT technology and mobility services in cities are evolving rapidly, and there are many public and private stakeholders involved in the design, and management of mobility and transport systems. To keep areas accessible and liveable there is a pressing need for advanced design methodologies that are capable of dealing with increasingly complex design problems such as location choice of mobility hubs, the number of shared vehicles offered at hubs and the number of parking spaces on different locations in a city.</p>

<p>Current urban mobility planning and design makes use of predictive digital twins based on classical traffic and transport models, in which a group of stakeholders interacts with a visual dashboard. In this approach, the stakeholders propose several designs, and transport models are used to assess the expected impacts of those designs on the modal-split, network performance, accessibility and other indicators. A substantial disadvantage of this approach is that only a limited number of designs can be considered. Another disadvantage is that only a small group of stakeholders decides about the designs, creating the risk that they unconsciously introduce bias towards specific population groups, areas and/or types of solutions.</p>

<p>The Mobility DesAIgn Lab focuses on novel ‘prescriptive’ digital twins that are based on AI and optimisation techniques and studies the ethical, legal, societal, and economic implications of using these prescriptive digital twins for urban mobility and spatial system design and management, enabling stakeholders to start using these prescriptive digital twins responsibly.</p>

<p>In this role you will be responsible for the generation and evaluation of the designs and management strategies that can be explored in the digital twin. The process of generating designs is steered by AI techniques, while the evaluation of designs is performed using existing transport models. These models simulate behaviour of travellers to compute a variety of indicators, such as modality choices, travel times, and accessibility measures, for different population groups. The indicators can be used to explore, compare and eventually choose designs in the use cases. You will collaborate closely with a fellow postdoc as well as  with researchers from TNO, the university of Leiden, and with several public and private partners.</p>

<h2>Postdoc in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback applied to mobility system design</h2>

<p>This vacancy will be made available soon via the <a href="https://careers.tudelft.nl/" target="_blank">careers website of TU Delft</a>. This section will be updated once the vacancy description is available.</p>
