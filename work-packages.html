	<h1>Work packages</h1>
<p>This page summarizes the Mobility DesAIgn Lab work packages. The lab is coordinated by dr. Maaike Snelder (TNO / TU Delft) and dr. ir. Erwin Walraven (TNO).</p>

<h3>WP1: Ethical and societal goal functions for design generation and evaluation</h3>
<p class="text-muted small">Delft University of Technology, prof. dr. ir. Bart van Arem</p>
<p>This work package focuses on the generation and evaluation of the designs that are shown in the digital twin. The assessment of mobility system designs will be performed using transport models, which simulate behaviour of travellers to compute a variety of indicators, such as modality choices, travel times and air quality. These indicators are used to compare various designs in the digital twin. However, in order to assess the impact of a design choice on citizens and specific population groups, it is crucial to have more fine-grained data and detailed indicators available.</p>

<h3>WP2: Robustness and transparent design recommendations</h3>
<p class="text-muted small">Delft University of Technology, prof. dr. Matthijs Spaan</p>
<p>This work package takes a set of designs with associated indicators and focuses on AI-based recommender systems to guide stakeholders in choosing a mobility system design. Recommendations can steer design choices of stakeholders in a specific direction without noticing, and therefore it will be investigated how to make this process more robust and aligned with the requirements imposed by the AI Act.</p>

<h3>WP3: Ethical, legal and societal implications and recommendations</h3>
<p class="text-muted small">TNO, prof. dr. ir. Anne Fleur van Veenstra</p>
<p>This work package focuses on the identification of legal implications for AI-supported mobility system design, and shapes future recommendations on regulations. The work package considers the AI Act as well as other regulatory frameworks that are relevant for applying AI in the context of mobility system design. A central element in the work package is Policy Lab, a methodology for formulating data-driven policies using new technologies such as digital twins, enabling stakeholders to experiment with new policies in a safe environment.</p>

<h3>WP4: ELSA design sessions for use cases</h3>
<p class="text-muted small">TNO, dr. ir. Erwin Walraven</p>
Work package 4 focuses on the use of a digital twin in three different use cases together with companies, public authorities and citizens. This is established by organizing design cycles, in which the digital twin is configured, and subsequently tested in a design session. During the design sessions the stakeholders can experience how cities can be designed, and which measures need to be taken into account. By organising multiple design cycles we support experimentation and the iterative development of knowledge, in relation to Policy Lab approach from work package 3.</p>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned work packages, there are additional work packages for networking activities, knowledge utilization and project management. These activities are coordinated by TNO.</p>
